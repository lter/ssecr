title: "Analysis & Modeling"
---

## Overview

Given the wide range in statistical training in graduate curricula (and corresponding breadth of experience among early career researchers), we'll be approaching this module in a different way than the others. One half of the module will use a "flipped approach" where project teams will share their proposed analyses with one another. The other half of the module will be dedicated to analyses that are more common in--or exclusive to--synthesis research.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module you will be able to: 

- <u>Describe</u> proposed analytical methods to an interested audience of mixed prior experience
- <u>Explain</u> nuance in interpretation of results of proposed analyses
- <u>Compare</u> and contrast interpretation of results in synthesis work versus primary research
- <u>Identify</u> statistical tests common in synthesis research
- <u>Perform</u> some synthesis-specific analyses

## Needed Packages

If you'd like to follow along with the code chunks included throughout this module, you'll need to install the following packages:

```{r install-pkgs}
#| eval: false

# Note that these lines only need to be run once per computer
## So you can skip this step if you've installed these before
install.packages("tidyverse")
```
