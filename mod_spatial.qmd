## Overview

Under Construction

## Learning Objectives

After completing this topic you will be able to: 

- <u>Define</u> characteristics of common types of spatial data
- <u>Manipulate</u> spatial data with R
- <u>Integrate</u> spatial data with tabular data

## Needed Packages

If you'd like to follow along with the code chunks included throughout this module, you'll need to install the following packages:

```{r install-pkgs}
#| eval: false

# Note that these lines only need to be run once per computer
## So you can skip this step if you've installed these before
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## Raster versus Vector Data



## Coordinate Reference Systems



## Making Maps



## Extracting Spatial Data



## Additional Spatial Resources
