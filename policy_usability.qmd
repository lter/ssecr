We are committed to creating a course that is inclusive in its design. If you encounter barriers, please let the instructors know immediately so that we can determine if there is a design adjustment that can be made or if an accommodation might be needed to overcome the limitations of the design. We are always happy to consider creative solutions as long as they do not compromise the intent of the learning activity. We welcome feedback that will assist us in improving the usability and experience for all students.
