# SSECR Contributing Guidelines

## Accessing Course Materials

### GitHub

We are using a GitHub Team (see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams) for more information) to simplify access protocols to SSECR GitHub materials.

Contact Marty Downs and/or Nick Lyon to be added to the SSECR GitHub Team. This will give you _write-level access_ to (A) the [SSECR GitHub repository](https://github.com/lter/ssecr) and (B) the [SSECR GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/lter/projects/6) that we're using for task management.

### Shared Drive

Contact Marty Downs and/or Nick Lyon for access to the Google Drive. The Shared Drive is named "LTER-Grad-Course".

### Communication

Communicating via email is fine though we also have a channel (`#lter-grad-course`) in [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)' Slack organization if that is preferable.

## Project Management

- Individual tasks should be tracked as [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart)
    - Be sure that each task is **SMART** (i.e., specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound)
- Use the issue template and try to document your progress as you work on a given task
- Strategic planning (i.e., across all tasks) should use the [SSECR GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/lter/projects/6/views/1)
    - Task lifecycle can be tracked by dragging an issue's "card" among columns that correspond to major steps in task completion

## Style Guide

As much as possible, use snake case (i.e., all_lowercase_separated_by_underscores). When in doubt, try to maintain consistency with the naming convention and internal structure of other files in the same directory/repository.
