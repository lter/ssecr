# SSECR Contributing Guidelines

## Accessing SSECR Materials

### GitHub

We are using a GitHub Team (see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams) for more information) to simplify access protocols to SSECR GitHub materials.

Contact Marty Downs and/or Nick Lyon to be added to the SSECR GitHub Team. This will give you _write-level access_ to (A) the [SSECR GitHub repository](https://github.com/lter/ssecr) and (B) the [SSECR GitHub Project](https://github.com/orgs/lter/projects/6) that we're using for task management.

### Shared Drive

Contact Marty Downs and/or Nick Lyon for access to the Google Drive. The Shared Drive is named "LTER-Grad-Course".

## Style Guide

As much as possible, use snake case (i.e., all_lowercase_separated_by_underscores). If in doubt, maintain consistency with the naming convention and internal structure of other files in the same directory/repository.
