title: "Data Discovery & Management"

## Overview

Synthesis projects often begin with a few datasets that inspire the questions--and end up incorporating dozens or hundreds of others. Researchers may seek out data that resemble their initial datasets, but come from other climates, ecosystems, or cultural settings. Or they may find that they need data of a completely different kind to establish drivers and context. The best synthesizers are resourceful in their search for data, cautious in evaluating data quality and relevance, and meticulous in documenting data sources, treatments, and related analytical decisions. In this workshop, we will cover all these aspects in enough depth for participants to begin finding and assessing their own project data. 

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module you will be able to: 

- <u>Identify</u> repositories "known for" a particular type of data
- <u>Explain</u> how to effectively search for data outside of specialized repositories
- <u>Create</u> a data inventory for identified data that allows for easy re-finding of those data products
- <u>Plan</u> how to download data in a reproducibly scripted way
- <u>Explain</u> how to handle different data formats (e.g., tabular, spatial, non-standard, etc.)
- <u>Perform</u> checks of the fundamental structure of a dataset

## Panel Discussion

To motivate this module and provide some beneficial context, we're beginning with a conversation with a panel composed of people who work at various organizations with a focus on data management and production. See the tabs below for each year's panelists and links to their professional sites.

Panelists will briefly introduce themselves and describe their roles. They will then speak to the kinds of data available at their organization and the strengths, limitations, and quirks of those data products from a synthesis lens. Individuals not associated with data repositories will instead share their experience working with specific types of data. Time allowing, panelists will talk about their experiences working at their organizations more broadly.
