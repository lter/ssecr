Group work is a significant part of this course explicitly in the synthesis project facet as well as implicitly by the collaborative nature of many of the modules. We expect that you will be mutually respectful with one another both in and outside of class time. We will ask you questions during the course and during class is also an ideal time for you all to ask us questions that you have on course topics or policies. We don't believe that "dumb questions" exist, and expect that you treat your peers' questions with the respect you'd like your questions to be with. We will learn more together in an environment where we build one another up than we would in one where we fail to support one another.
