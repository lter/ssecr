title: "Reproducibility Best Practices"
---

## Overview

As we set out to engage with the synthesis skills this course aims to offer, it will be helpful to begin with a careful consideration of "reproducibility." Because synthesis projects draw data from many sources and typically involve many researchers working in concert, reproducibility is particularly important. In individual projects, adhering to reproducibility best practices is certainly a good goal but failing to do so for synthesis projects can severely limit the work in a more significant way than for those individual projects. "Reproducibility" is a wide sphere encompassing many different--albeit related--topics so it can be challenging to feel well-equipped to evaluate how well we are following these guidelines in our own work. In this module, we will cover a few fundamental facets of reproducibility and point to some considerations that may encourage you to push yourself to elevate your practices to the next level.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module you will be able to: 

- <u>Identify</u> core tenets of reproducibility best practices
- <u>Create</u> reproducible workflow documentation
- <u>Implement</u> reproducible project organization strategies
- <u>Discuss</u> methods for improving the reproducibility of your code products
- <u></u> x
- <u></u> x
- <u>Summarize</u> FAIR and CARE data principles
- <u>Evaluate</u> the FAIR/CAREness of your work

### FAIR & CARE

FAIR is an acronym for <u>F</u>indable <u>A</u>ccessible <u>I</u>nterpoerable and <u>R</u>eusable

While making data and code more FAIR is often a good ideal the philosophy behind those four criteria come from a perspective that emphasizes data sharing as a good in and of itself. This approach can ignore historical context and contemporary power differentials and thus be insufficient as the _sole_ tool to use in evaluating how data/code are shared and stored. The [Global Indigenous Data Alliance](https://www.gida-global.org/) (GIDA) created the CARE principles with these ethical considerations explicitly built into their tenets.

CARE stands for <u>C</u>ollective Benefit, <u>A</u>uthority to Control, <u>R</u>esponsibility, and <u>E</u>thics.
