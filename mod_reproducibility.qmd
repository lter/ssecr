### FAIR & CARE

FAIR is an acronym for <u>F</u>indable <u>A</u>ccessible <u>I</u>nterpoerable and <u>R</u>eusable

While making data and code more FAIR is often a good ideal the philosophy behind those four criteria come from a perspective that emphasizes data sharing as a good in and of itself. This approach can ignore historical context and contemporary power differentials and thus be insufficient as the _sole_ tool to use in evaluating how data/code are shared and stored. The [Global Indigenous Data Alliance](https://www.gida-global.org/) (GIDA) created the CARE principles with these ethical considerations explicitly built into their tenets.

CARE stands for <u>C</u>ollective Benefit, <u>A</u>uthority to Control, <u>R</u>esponsibility, and <u>E</u>thics.
