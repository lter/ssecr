If you get sick, observe a religious holiday unaccounted for by the SSECR schedule, have to miss class for an interview, or simply don't think you can handle class on a given day, please email the course instructors as early as possible to let us know that you won't be in class with a (brief) explanation. This will help us to share resources we'll cover in class with you and plan for a smaller in-class community while you are out. Our hope is that this course will be somewhere you *want* to attend, but we totally understand that you have many demands on your time and sometimes life happens!

Please keep in mind that your presence in and contributions to class are important both to your understanding of the material and the creation and maintenance of an in-class community.
