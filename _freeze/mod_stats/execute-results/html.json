One half of the module will use a \"flipped approach\" where project teams will share their proposed analyses with one another. The other half of the module will be dedicated to analyses that are more common in--or exclusive to--synthesis research.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\nAfter completing this module you will be able to: \n\n- <u>Describe</u> proposed analytical methods to an interested audience of mixed prior experience\n- <u>Explain</u> nuance in interpretation of results of proposed analyses\n- <u>Compare</u> and contrast interpretation of results in synthesis work versus primary research\n- <u>Identify</u> statistical tests common in synthesis research\n- <u>Perform</u> some synthesis-specific analyses\n\n## Needed Packages\n\nIf you'd like to follow along with the code chunks included throughout this module, you'll need to install the following packages:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Note that these lines only need to be run once per computer\n## So you can skip this step if you've installed these before\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Module Content\n\n\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n### Papers & Documents\n\n- [Doing Meta-Analysis with R: A Hands-On Guide](https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/)\n\n### Workshops & Courses\n\n- \n\n### Websites\n\n- \n",
