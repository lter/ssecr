title: "Team Science Practices"
---

## Overview

In this module, we'll dive into some of the literature underlying our recommended team science practices (the science of team science). We'll also explore some of the more common types of conflicts that arise in synthesis work and ways to anticipate, prevent (when possible), and resolve those conflicts. 

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module you will be able to: 

- <u>Interpret</u> and enact current best practices in team science
- <u>Identify</u> different interaction styles and the effect they have on group dynamics
- <u>Identify</u> benefits (and potential costs of) diverse teams
- <u>Describe</u> ways to mitigate costs of diverse teams
- <u>Explain</u> methods for improving the experience of virtual participants on hybrid teams 

## Preparation

Each project group should:

- Plan on providing a project summary and update on recent progress and any questions/issues that are arising
- Finish their internal ground rules (if not already complete)

## Module Content

Under Construction, stay tuned!
