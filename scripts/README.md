# SSECR Scripts

It is periodically useful to have 'background scripts' for doing operations that support SSECR modules/topics but aren't valuable to include in the instructional materials in and of themselves. Such scripts live in this folder. For specific details of a given script, open that script and check the internal documentation in the first few lines and consult the comments throughout.

## Script Summaries

- `prep-data_mixed-effects` -- simulates data with a random effect structure. Used in the statistics module
- `prep-data_spatial` -- prepares existing vector and raster data to be used for the course. Used in the spatial module
