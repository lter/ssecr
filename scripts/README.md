# SSECR Scripts

It is periodically useful to have 'background scripts' for doing operations that support SSECR modules/topics but aren't valuable to include in the instructional materials in and of themselves. Such scripts live in this folder.

For details on the purpose of a given script, open that script and check the internal documentation in the first few lines and consult the comments.
