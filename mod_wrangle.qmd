title: "Data Harmonization & Wrangling"
---

## Overview

Now that we have covered how to find data and use data visualization methods to explore it, we can move on to combining separate data files and preparing that combined data file for analysis. For the purposes of this module we're adopting a very narrow view of harmonization and a very broad view of wrangling but this distinction aligns well with two discrete philosophical/logistical arenas. To make those definitions explicit:

- <u>"Harmonization" = process of combining separate primary data objects into one object</u>. This includes things like synonymizing columns, or changing data format to support combination. This _excludes_ quality control steps--even those that are undertaken before harmonization begins.

- <u>"Wrangling" = all modifications to data meant to create an analysis-ready 'tidy' data object</u>. This includes quality control, unit conversions, and data 'shape' changes to name a few. Note that attaching ancillary data to your primary data object (e.g., attaching temperature data to a dataset on plant species composition) _also falls into this category!_

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module you will be able to: 

- <u>Identify</u> typical steps in data harmonization and wrangling workflows
- <u>Create</u> a harmonization workflow

## Harmonizing Data

Data harmonization is an interesting topic in that it is _vital_ for synthesis projects but only very rarely relevant for primary research. Synthesis projects must reckon with the data choices made by each team of original data collectors. These collectors may or may not have recorded their judgement calls (or indeed, any metadata) but before synthesis work can be meaningfully done these independent datasets must be made comparable to one another and combined.

For tabular data, we recommend using the [`ltertools` R package](https://lter.github.io/ltertools/) to perform any needed harmonization. This package relies on a "column key" to translate the original column names into equivalents that apply across all datasets. Users can generate this column key however they would like but Google Sheets is a strong option as it allows multiple synthesis team members to simultaneously work on filling in the needed bits of the key.

The column key requires three columns:

1. "source" -- Name of the raw file
2. "raw_name" -- Name of all raw columns in that file to be synonymized
3. "tidy_name" -- New name for each raw column that should be carried to the harmonized data

Note that any raw names either not included in the column key or that lack a tidy name equivalent will be excluded from the final data object. For more information, consult the [`ltertools` package vignette](https://lter.github.io/ltertools/articles/ltertools.html). For convenience, we're attaching the visual diagram of this method of harmonization included in the `ltertools` vignette below.
