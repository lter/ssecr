title: "Reproducible Reports"
---

## Overview

At this point in the course, we anticipate that you're likely approaching the end of your team's synthesis project (see our suggested [milestones](https://lter.github.io/ssecr/proj_milestones.html) page for more information). As the end of your project and the course as a whole nears, it might be valuable for your group to consider how you can reproducibly document all of the work you've been doing for the last several months. Reproducible reports (e.g., RMarkdown files, Quarto documents, etc.) can be an effective way of documenting your results in a format that allows you to leverage _both_ your technical skills and your scientific communication skills. This module focuses on the structure and content of these reports from a <u>primarily technical</u> lens, so please consult the [communicating findings](https://lter.github.io/ssecr/mod_findings.html) module for the team science perspective.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module you will be able to: 

- <u>Describe</u> contexts where RMarkdown/Quarto documents are useful
- <u>Identify</u> the three fundamental elements of RMarkdown/Quarto documents
