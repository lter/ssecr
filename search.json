    "text": "Module Content\n\nProject Organization & Documentation\n\n\nReproducible Coding\n\n\nFAIR & CARE Data Principles\nData availability, data size, and demand for transparency by government and funding agencies are all steadily increasing. While ensuring that your project and code practices are reproducible is important, it is also important to consider how open and reproducible your data are as well. Synthesis projects are in a unique position here because synthesis projects use data that may have been previously published on and/or be added to a public data repository by the original data collectors. However, synthesis projects take data from these different sources and wrangle it such that the different data sources are comparable to one another. These ‘synthesis data products’ can be valuable to consider archiving in a public repository to save other researchers from needing to re-run your entire wrangling workflow in order to get the data product.\nIn either primary or synthesis research contexts there are several valuable frameworks to consider as data structure and metadata are being decided. Among these are the FAIR and CARE data principles. We will begin with a discussion of FAIR data practices.\n\nFAIR\nFAIR is an acronym for Findable Accessible Interpoerable and Reusable. Each element of the FAIR principles can be broken into a set of concrete actions that you can take throughout the lifecycle of your project to ensure that your data are open and transparent. Perhaps most importantly, FAIR data are most easily used by other research teams in the future so the future impact of your work is–in some ways–dependent upon how thoroughly you consider these actions.\nConsider the following list of actions you might take to make your data FAIR. Note that not all actions may be appropriate for all types of data (see our discussion of the CARE principles below), but these guidelines are still important to consider–even if you ultimately choose to reject some of them. Virtually all of the guidelines considered below apply to metadata (i.e., the formal documentation describing your data) and the ‘actual’ data but for ease of reference we will call both of these resources “data.”\n\nFindability\n\nEnsure that data have a globally unique and persistent identifier\nCompletely fill out all metadata details\nRegister/index data in a searchable resource\n\nAccessibility\n\nStore data in a file format that is open, free, and universally implementable (e.g., CSV rather than MS Excel, etc.)\nEnsure that metadata will be available even if the data they describe are not\n\nInteroperability\n\nUse formal, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation\n\nThis can mean using full species names rather than codes or shorthand that may not be widely known\n\nUse vocabularies that are broadly used and that themselves follow FAIR principles\nInclude explicit references to other FAIR data\n\nReusability\n\nDescribe your data with rich detail that covers a plurality of relevant attributes\nAttach a clear data usage license so that secondary data users know how they are allowed to use your data\nInclude detailed provenance information about your data\nEnsure that your data meet discipline-specific community standards\n\n\n\nCARE\nWhile making data and code more FAIR is often a good ideal the philosophy behind those four criteria come from a perspective that emphasizes data sharing as a good in and of itself. This approach can ignore historical context and contemporary power differentials and thus be insufficient as the sole tool to use in evaluating how data/code are shared and stored. The Global Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA) created the CARE principles with these ethical considerations explicitly built into their tenets. Before making your data widely available and transparent (ideally before even beginning your research), it is crucial to consider this ethical dimension.\nCARE stands for Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, and Ethics. Ensuring that your data meet these criteria helps to advance Indigenous data sovereignty and respects those who have been–and continue to be–collecting knowledge about the world around us for millennia. The following actions are adapted from Jennings et al. 2023 (linked at the bottom of this page).\nCollective Benefit\n\nDemonstrate how your research and its potential results are relevant and of value to the interests of the community at large and its individual members\nInclude and value local community experts in the research team\nUse classifications and categories in ways defined by Indigenous communities and individuals\nDisaggregate large geographic scale data to increase relevance for place-specific Indigenous priorities\nCompensate community experts throughout the research process (proposal development through to community review of _pre-_publication manuscripts)\n\nAuthority to Control\n\nEstablish institutional principles or protocoles that explicitly recognize Indigenous Peoples’ rights to and interests in their knowledges/data\nEnsure data collection and distribution are consistent with individual and community consent provisions and that consent is ongoing (including the right to withdraw or refuse)\nEnsure Indigenous communities have access to the (meta)data in usable format\n\nResponsibility\n\nCreate and expand opportunities for community capacity\nRecord the Traditional Knowledge and biocultural labels of the Local Contexts Hub in metadata\nEnsure review of draft publications before publication\nUse the languages of Indigenous Peoples in the (meta)data\n\nEthics\n\nAccess research using Indigenous ethical frameworks\nUse community-defined review processes with appropriate reviewers for activities delineated in data management plans\nWork to maximize benefits from the perspectives of Indigenous Peoples by clear and transparent dialogue with communities and individuals\nEngage with community guidelines for the use and reuse of data (including facilitating data removal and/or disposal requests from aggregated datasets)",
