title: "Authorship & Intellectual Credit"
---

## Overview

Group synthesis requires many types of contributions, from raw data to idea generation, analysis, group organization, figure development, conceptualizing, writing, and editing. Often, little of this work is directly compensated. Conflicts and misunderstandings about what contributions earn authorship arise -- especially in the absence of a clearly articulated policy on intellectual credit. In this module we will discuss a few models for aligning expectations around intellectual credit and how they may differ depending on the participants and the particular product the group is developing. We'll also take some time for project groups to develop or refine their own intellect credit policies.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module you will be able to:

-   <u>Define</u> types of intellectual contributions to a synthesis project
-   <u>Describe</u> some common frameworks for equitable authorship decisions
-   <u>Explain</u> benefits (or avoided costs) of making authorship decisions both collaboratively and transparently
-   <u>Create</u> a draft intellectual credit plan for your team

## Preparation

## Intellectual Credit Module Content

In their [Code of Ethics](https://esa.org/about/code-of-ethics/) the Ecological Society of America lays out what seems like straightforward guidance for what contributions warrant authorship on a paper:

> 22. Researchers will claim authorship of a paper only if they have made a substantial contribution. Authorship may legitimately be claimed if researchers
>
>     1.  conceived the ideas or experimental design;
>
>     2.  participated actively in execution of the study;
>
>     3.  analyzed and interpreted the data; or
>
>     4.  wrote the manuscript

Even in the context of traditional research projects, with a discrete experimental design, sample collection, and analysis, appropriate allocation of authorship can be challenging to determine. In the context of a multidisciplinary group project, where each contributor may have limited knowledge of the others' fields or expertise, fairly judging authorship becomes much more complicated. In synthesis work, the ultimate analytical design often results from multiple overlapping and often free-wheeling conversations and trials. In such cases, the potential for misunderstanding and conflict becomes obvious.

Of course, human psychology also has a role to play. It is quite common for individuals to overestimate their own contribution to the work of a team, especially when the outcome is positive. Nelson et al. (2020) examined the phenomenon in the context of scientific publishing and found that authors almost universally over-estimated their own contribution to a project, at least with respect to how their team members percieved it.

The red dash-dotted line represents the sum of coauthors’ contributions after they were given the opportunity to adjust their own percent contribution. In (B) we show the mean percent contribution assigned by coauthors to themselves in Step 1 (“Self”), percent contribution coauthors assigned to themselves after given the opportunity to adjust their contribution not to exceed 100% in Step 2 (“Self-Corrected”), and mean percent contribution assigned to authors by their coauthors (“Other”). Error bars represent standard errors of the means. \*\*p\<.01, \*\*\*p\<.0001.](images/credit-fig-1.jpeg){fig-alt="Column graph with the sum of authors' self-reported contributions exceeding 100% by 17 to 158%." fig-align="center"}
