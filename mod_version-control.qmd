title: "Version Control"
---

## Overview

Synthesis projects require an intensely collaborative team spirit complemented by an emphasis on quantitative rigor. While other modules focus on elements of each of these, version control is a useful tool that lives at their intersection. We will shortly embark on a deep dive into version control but broadly it is a method of tracking changes to files (especially code "scripts") that lends itself remarkably well to coding in groups. The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)) has a [Scientific Computing Team](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/) that developed a robust workshop-style set of materials aimed at teaching version control to LTER-funded synthesis working groups. Rather than reinvent these materials for the purposes of SSECR, we will work through parts of these workshop materials.
