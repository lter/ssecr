title: "Version Control"
---

## Overview

Synthesis projects require an intensely collaborative team spirit complemented by an emphasis on quantitative rigor. While other modules focus on elements of each of these, version control is a useful tool that lives at their intersection. We will shortly embark on a deep dive into version control but broadly it is a method of tracking changes to files (especially code "scripts") that lends itself remarkably well to coding in groups. The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)) has a [Scientific Computing Team](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp.github.io/) that developed a robust workshop-style set of materials aimed at teaching version control to LTER-funded synthesis working groups. Rather than reinvent these materials for the purposes of SSECR, we will work through parts of these workshop materials.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module you will be able to: 

- <u>Describe</u> how version control facilitates code collaboration
- <u>Navigate</u> GitHub via a web browser
- <u>Create</u> and edit a repository through GitHub
- <u>Define</u> fundamental git vocabulary
- <u>Sketch</u> the RStudio-to-GitHub order of operations
- <u>Use</u> RStudio, Git, and GitHub to collaborate with version control

## Module Content

The workshop materials we will be working through live [here](https://nceas.github.io/scicomp-workshop-collaborative-coding/) but for convenience we have also embedded the workshop directly into the SSECR course website (see below).
