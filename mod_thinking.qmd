title: "Supporting Divergent, Emergent, and Convergent Thinking"
---

## Overview

As many course participants will have discovered by now, the process of deciding on, refining, and choosing a path forward for data analysis will involve many differing opinions and perspectives. To work effectively as a group, you will need to elicit a broad range of ideas and then combine and focus them. This can be unfamiliar territory for researchers who have mainly pursued individual projects. While the particulars of each project are different, the patterns are often similar and being familiar with a few approaches for eliciting the best from yourself and colleagues can speed the process and improve the experience for all involved.

Below you will find support for your group as you move through both exciting, and sometimes uncomfortable, stages of collaborative, participatory decision-making - from divergent to emergent and finally convergent thinking.

[Bala Chaudhary](https://balachaudhary.com/index.html#/) is a soil ecologist specializing in plant-soil-microbial interactions and mycorrhizal symbioses. Research in her lab examines ecosystem-scale questions in mycorrhizal ecology along four main themes: microbial dispersal at the macrosystems scale, trait-based mycorrhizal ecology, synthesis in ecology, and microbial mediation of global change solutions. She uses trait-based approaches to develop predictive frameworks for mycorrhizal dispersal, community assembly, and biogeography, and employs complimentary approaches of macroecological field work, controlled lab experiments, and data synthesis to study multi-scale questions in ecology. Her work spans dozens of ecosystem types and has applications in global change solutions including climate mitigation and adaptation, soil conservation, ecosystem restoration, and sustainable agriculture. She also conducts research on ways to broaden scientific participation and promote racial and ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM.

## Module Content

At the beginning of a collaborative process, the most important initial outcome is **getting convergence or group alignment on a set of shared goals and objectives and a plan for how to achieve them/**. If your team process is effective, this plan will be an _inclusive solution_ – one that works for everyone in the group. Achieving this shared vision can be more difficult than one might expect. While you may expect that participants have already agreed to the vision in joining the group, agreement does not always equate to alignment. This module focuses on tools and resources to help your group navigate to convergent, inclusive solutions that everyone on the team can align around.

### Embracing divergent thinking

The first stage of group decision making is divergent thinking (Kaner et al. 2014). Confronted with a new, complex topic, the group will gradually move from the safe territory of familiar opinions into sharing their diverse perspectives and exploring new ideas. This can feel like the group process is devolving away from what was assumed to be shared agreement, but it is actually a critical part of the collaborative process.

When a diverse group comes together to work on a complex problem, their views are likely to diverge widely across many dimensions from problem definition to priorities to methods/approaches to the definition of success. But you can tap that divergent thinking to generate entirely new ideas and options that emerge through the group’s productive struggle for mutual understanding.

While your working group is in the divergent thinking stage, it’s critical to foster dialogue to surface different perspectives. Examine hidden assumptions. Create room for disagreement and questioning. Amplify diverse perspectives - and particularly, voices from the edge (e.g., junior members, new collaborators, people from different disciplines, non-scientists who may be affected by the research) - in order to expand the range of possibilities. Mirror and validate what you hear. Invite people who are good at bridging across disciplinary or other differences to help translate and build shared understanding of methods and ways of thinking. Suspend judgment and encourage full participation. 

Beware of the most common pitfall at this stage, which is to converge too quickly on an early conclusion, staying in the safe space of familiar opinions and status quo solutions. You can prepare for this stage and help to avoid that pitfall by reviewing prior work and synthesizing data and knowledge gaps, promising approaches, and critical questions. Your team can use that synthesis of the current state of the science as a jumping off point.

### Making it through the groan zone

It’s natural for groups to go through a period of confusion and frustration as they struggle to integrate their diverse perspectives into a shared framework of understanding (Kaner et al. 2014). The goal is to get the group across this no man’s land between divergent thinking and convergence known as the [“groan zone.”](https://i2insights.org/2019/05/28/collaboration-groan-zone/) In the groan zone, the group leader or facilitator’s job is to keep the group from getting frustrated and shutting down.  

While the groan zone can be challenging, it can also be an extremely fruitful and creative stage. Here in the messy middle of a group process, an open and flexible mindset and a process that invites participants to engage in emergent thinking can enable true innovation. Emergent thinking builds upon ideas generated in the divergent thinking stage, recombining or adapting them in novel ways. It seeks to identify patterns and make meaning in the face of complexity and uncertainty. Done well, _emergent thinking enables a group to adapt, sense opportunities, and generate new and exciting ideas._

Tab 1 -  Rapid Brainstorm Exercise
A variety of factors and dynamics can impede emergent thinking and make the groan zone especially challenging. What have you observed?

Tab 2 - Some factors that can impede emergent thinking include:

Disciplinary differences in epistemology, vocabulary, and methods that impede understanding
Analysis paralysis - getting lost in the weeds of endless analysis and detail
Polarization - opposite camps anchored in
Power dynamics that squelch creative contributions from the “edges”
Avoidance of a deeper issue impeding collaboration (e.g. lack of trust)
Turf wars, competition
Risk aversion, perception management, fear of failure / getting it wrong
Confirmation bias and resistance to ideas that challenge group identity and beliefs

Some useful techniques for navigating the groan zone and fostering emergent thinking include:
 
Cultivating presence and patience 
Having a neutral facilitator create the conditions for open, inclusive dialogue
Building shared understanding via translation (e.g. across disciplines), metacognition (thinking about how you are thinking), and inquiry 
Exploring new data, models, and ways of presenting information
Creating categories to reveal structure and allow sorting and prioritization of ideas
Combining or recombining ideas or methods to yield new approaches
Working together to separate facts from opinions
Carefully examining language, e.g. by looking word by word at a key statement or question that is being debated and asking what questions each word raises
Capturing side issues in writing and reserve time to revisit these – taking the tangents seriously is a critical part of letting participants know you value their contributions
Examining how proposed ideas might affect each individual in the group
Honoring objections to the process and asking for suggestions
Addressing power imbalances and elevating voices from the “edge” 
 
To keep the conversation in the realm of productive dialogue, use active listening and facilitation techniques that help participants to avoid taking it personally, for example, these from Peter Senge that create SPACE for dialogue.

If you find the conversation getting off track or the dynamics becoming difficult, useful techniques that allow you to remain committed to being supportive and respectful of all group members (including ones you might experience as “difficult”) include:
 
Reminding individuals of the larger purpose of the group and reconnecting them to their own personal reasons for caring about and working on the issue, e.g. by inviting them to take a moment to reflect or to restate what success looks like
Focusing on common ground and areas of potential alignment
Inviting constructive opposition - ask the critic to say what they can support about a given proposal and what they would like to see changed or discussed further
Switching the participation format (e.g., going to breakout groups, brainstorming, a go-around, or individual writing)
Taking a break
Stepping out of the content and addressing the process
Educating members about group dynamics and asking them to reflect on how they are showing up
Encouraging more people to participate
Reframing the discussion, e.g. by surfacing underlying issues, and/or focusing on concrete actions that the group can take to resolve the conflict
 
Don’t get discouraged by the groan zone. Misunderstanding and miscommunication are normal parts of the process of collaboration. And even more importantly, “the act of working through these misunderstandings is what builds the foundation for sustainable agreements [and]… meaningful collaboration” (Kaner et al. 2014).

### Getting to convergence
Once the group has a strong foundation of shared understanding, things often start to click into place and feel easier and faster as you enter the zone of convergent thinking. At this point, the group is ready to devise inclusive solutions, weigh alternatives and make decisions. As the group leader your role is to help the group devise specific proposals, evaluate and decide among them, refine and synthesize into an overall approach, and lay out a concrete plan. The risk at this stage is that the group never converges on a clear decision or plan, leading the group to spin its wheels in the future.

Techniques that are useful in this phase include:
 
Pulling up concrete examples for inspiration
Clarifying selection criteria and evaluating proposals against them
Creative reframing or recombination to support more innovative, inclusive solutions
Deciding what ideas to pursue and which to keep on the back burner in case the team needs to adapt
Defining steps and milestones, planning the work flow, and assigning roles and responsibilities

While the big work of the initial stage of a synthesis science project is getting to convergence on the overall work plan, you should expect that the group may go through the process of divergence and convergence again at multiple points in the process as they dive into the work and uncover new challenges. But the shared understanding and social rapport that come from successfully struggling together early on will allow the group to more easily and rapidly develop and implement new solutions in subsequent meetings.

Small Group Exercise #1 - Where are we in the diamond?
Purpose: Identify where your group is in the diamond model right now and what stage you need to move through next. 
Process: 1-team-all (25 mins)
Individual reflection (2 mins) - 
Where would you say your group is right now in the diamond model? Have you been leveraging the relevant thinking for the stage you are in (divergent, emergent, or convergent)? 
Think about the next group work or decisionmaking task that lies ahead - what stage(s) of the diamond will that work take you through and what kind of thinking will be needed?
Small group discussion (15 mins)
Identify a reporter, notetaker, and facilitator/timekeeper
Go around and share your answers to the prompt (1 min each)
Discuss and try to reach consensus about which stage(s) of the diamond model best match the next chunk of work you have ahead of you.
Report out (5 mins)
